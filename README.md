**Just Make Paintings Transparent** is a mod that makes paintings (and a few other entities) support multple forms of transparency.

![A comparison between the three modes: SOLID/OFF, CUTOUT and TRANSPARENT.](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/OAY12MbC/images/0182f6e9443c3df94b3bb0f94f43c96e92dc3bca.png)

The entities supported so far are:
- paintings;
- end crystals;
- and item frames (glow item frames included).

By default, all supported entities are set to **TRANSPARENT**. A config file is provided to let you individually select the transparency level for each entity, found as jumapat.mcf in your game's configs folder. The valid choices for each entity are **SOLID/OFF** (the default for the entity), **CUTOUT** (equivalent to CutoutNoCull) and **TRANSPARENT** (equivalent to Translucent). **Note that the config is case sensitive!** If you don't understand what any of this means - unless you're optimizing for every last bit of performance, the default settings should be good enough.
